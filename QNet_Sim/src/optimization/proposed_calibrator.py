"""Resource-aware penalty calibration for the QiOpt4QNet QUBO.

For each edge/memory resource and candidate bundle, ask how much the squared
capacity-overload penalty decreases when that bundle is removed from a
violating configuration. The coefficient is chosen above the largest ratio
of positive bundle utility to that penalty decrease over reachable competing
loads.

This is an instance-aware *single-bundle removal bound* for the capacity terms.
The request-conflict coefficient A intentionally remains identical to the
conventional utility-scale rule so that experiments isolate the effect of
resource-aware B/D calibration.

Reachable loads are computed with bounded dynamic programming rather than a
full Cartesian-product enumeration.
